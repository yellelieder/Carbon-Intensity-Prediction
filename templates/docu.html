<h1>Technical Documentation</h1>

<h2>General</h2>
<p>The system is written in python. The frontend is only for demo puroses and basically plain html. There are a few JavaScript functions and a tiny fraction of css</p>

<h2>Server</h2>
<p>The webserver uses Flask and Flask Restfull.</p>

<h2>Scraper</h2>
<p>To predict future energy production and consumption, historial data are scraped from <a href="https://www.smard.de/en", target="blank">smard.de</a>. Most recent data is automatically scraped by the system to further improve the prediction accuracy.</p>
<h2>Data cleaning</h2>
<p>Data cleaning is automatically done by the system after cleaning. All the input csv files are always merged and prepared to perform machine learining on them.</p>

<h2>Weather API</h2>
<p><a href="https://openweathermap.org/", target="blank">openweathermap.org</a> provide free access for student to some of their APIs.
The system conciders a 30 day, daily climate forcast and a 4 day hourly weather forcast </p>

<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Predictions are based on a Auto Regression Model from the python statsmodels library.</p>
<p>The prediction made with the AR Model has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation", target="blank">RMSE</a> of about 1404 MWh. </p>

<h2>Prediction</h2>
<p>Predictions by the system are based on the follwing decision tree:</p>
<img src="\static\png\PredictinoPath.png" alt="Prediction decision graph">
<p>The distinction between climate and weather forcast is, that the climate forcast is just a rough estimation for the next 30 days and does not include any precise preditions for wind. 
<br>For the climate forcast, the system first selects those days, where there are the highest windspeed expected. Then the system selects the ideal start time based on surise and sunset so the process is performed during the maximum amout of sun hours.
